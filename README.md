The purpose of this program is to help with Sudoku-variant puzzles that are crossed with kakuros, often referred to as [Killer Sudoku](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_sudoku).

You often have to find a certain sum that is composed of a certain number of digits, and excludes certain digits.

For example, find all combinations of FOUR digits that add up to TWENTY and exclude the digits TWO and SEVEN.  The result would be:  
[8, 5, 4, 3]  
[8, 6, 5, 1]  
[9, 6, 4, 1]  

This is a very simple program, with a single class.  To edit the parameters (the number of digits, the sum, and the digits to exclude), you simply edit the constants in the class.  Then run the class in your IDE or from the command-line, and the results will be printed to standard output.
